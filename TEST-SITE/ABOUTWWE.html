<h2>About WWE</h2>
  <hr>
  <p class="first"><b>World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., d/b/a WWE, is an American integrated media and entertainment company[8][9]
  that primarily is known for professional wrestling. WWE has also branched out into other fields, including movies, real estate, and
  various other business ventures.The WWE name also refers to the professional wrestling promotion itself, founded by Jess McMahon and 
  Toots Mondt in 1952 as the Capitol Wrestling Corporation. As of 2018, it is the largest wrestling promotion in the world, holding 
  over 500 events a year, with the roster divided up into various globally traveling brands,[10] and is available to about 36 million
  viewers in more than 150 countries. The company's global headquarters is located in Stamford, Connecticut, with offices in major
  cities across the world.
 As in other professional wrestling promotions, WWE shows are not legitimate contests, but purely entertainment-based, featuring storyline-driven,
 scripted, and choreographed matches, though matches often included moves that can put performers at risk of injury if not performed correctly. 
 This was first publicly acknowledged by WWE's owner Vince McMahon in 1989 to avoid taxes from athletic commissions. Since the 1980s,

 WWE publicly has branded their product as sports entertainment, acknowledging the product's roots in competitive sport and dramatic theater.</p>
<h3>History of wwe</h3>
<hr>
<p class="second">
 WWE's origins can be traced back as far as 1952 when Roderick James "Jess" McMahon and Toots Mondt created the Capitol Wrestling Corporation
 Ltd. (CWC), which joined the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) in 1953. McMahon, who was a successful boxing promoter, began working with 
 Tex Rickard in 1926. With the help of Rickard, he began promoting boxing and wrestling at the third Madison Square Garden. It was not the
 first time McMahon had promoted wrestling cards, as he had already done so during the 1910s.Vincent J. McMahon's son, Vincent K. McMahon,
 and his wife Linda, established Titan Sports, Inc., in 1980 in South Yarmouth, Massachusetts.[20][21] The company was incorporated on 
 February 21, 1980, in the Cape Cod Coliseum offices. The younger McMahon bought Capitol from his father in 1982, effectively seizing
 control of the company. Seeking to make the WWF the premier wrestling promotion in the country, and eventually, the world, he began an
 expansion process that fundamentally changed the wrestling business.
 On December 13, 2017, WWE and Facebook announced a new Internet in-ring series called WWE Mixed Match Challenge that will stream live in
 the U.S. exclusively on Facebook Watch. Premiering on January 16, 2018, the 12-episode series will feature wrestlers from both the Raw
 and SmackDown rosters competing in a single-elimination mixed tag-team tournament to win $100,000 to support the charity of their choice.
 Each episode will be 20 minutes long and will air at 10 p.m. ET/7 p.m. PT
